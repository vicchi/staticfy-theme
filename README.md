An opinionated [Nikola](https://getnikola.com) [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) theme that can be seen in the wild at [www.vicchi.org](https://www.vicchi.org).

This is a personal project and relies on my own, opinionated, Nikola setup that works for my blog. It might be useful as an example of how to create a Nikola theme. Or not. YMMV.
